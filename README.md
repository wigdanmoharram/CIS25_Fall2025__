Week 6 – Pointers, Structs, Dynamic Memory, and Binary Search

This program demonstrates the key concepts from Module 7:

- Creation of a `struct` named Item with two fields: `name` and `id`
- Use of dynamic memory allocation with `new` to create an array of Item objects
- Storing (100) sorted records in the arrays
- Implementation of a binary search function to search for an item by ID
- User input where the user enters an ID to search for
- Displaying whether the item was found, and showing its name and ID if it exists
- Releasing memory using `delete[]` to prevent memory leaks

How to Run the Program:
1. Copy the code into JDoodle (C++ Online Compiler) or any C++ compiler.
2. Click "Execute" to run the program.
3. When prompted, enter an ID number between 1 and 100.
4. The program will display whether the item was found or not I chose (95).
5. The dynamic memory is freed at the end using `delete[]`.
